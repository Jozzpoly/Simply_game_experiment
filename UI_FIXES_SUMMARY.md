# UI Display Issues - Comprehensive Analysis and Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Duplicate XP Bars** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Two XP bars were being displayed simultaneously:
- `XPProgressBar` from `ui.ui_elements` (drawn in `game.py` line 366)
- Built-in XP bar in `level.level.py` (lines 498-506)

**Solution**: 
- Removed the duplicate XP bar code from `level.level.py` (lines 498-506)
- Kept only the enhanced `XPProgressBar` from `ui.ui_elements`
- Added comment explaining the change

### 2. **UI Layout Conflicts** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: UI elements were overlapping due to poor positioning:
- `XPProgressBar` was at (10, 10) overlapping with health bar
- Player level text was conflicting with XP bar position

**Solution**:
- Moved `XPProgressBar` from (10, 10) to (10, 35) to position below health bar
- Moved player level text from (10, 40) to (10, 65) to avoid XP bar overlap
- Adjusted special effects indicators from y=110 to y=90 for better spacing

### 3. **Health Bar Display** ✅ VERIFIED
**Status**: Health bar was already working correctly
- Positioned at (10, 10) with proper red background and green fill
- Displays health text with current/max values
- No issues found with health bar functionality

## Files Modified

### `level/level.py`
- **Lines 494-506**: Removed duplicate XP bar drawing code
- **Line 495**: Updated player level text position to (10, 65)
- **Line 506**: Adjusted special effects indicators starting position to y=90

### `game.py`
- **Line 59**: Updated XPProgressBar position to (10, 35)
- **Line 125**: Updated XPProgressBar position in fullscreen toggle function

## Current UI Layout (Fixed)

```
