## 🛠️ **Improvements Implemented**

### 1. **Equipment Display Improvements** ✅
**Enhanced Stat Formatting**:
- **Percentage Stats**: Show as percentages with proper decimal places

  - `damage_bonus: 5.0` → `+5`
  - `health_bonus: 25.0` → `+25`
- **Decimal Stats**: Show with appropriate precision
  - `speed_bonus: 1.2` → `+1.20`

**Implementation**:
```python
def get_formatted_stat_bonus(self, stat_name: str) -> str:

    # Distinguishes between percentage, integer, and decimal stats
    # Returns properly formatted display strings
