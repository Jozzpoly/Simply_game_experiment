# PowerShell Fixes Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Fixed PowerShell syntax errors that were preventing proper execution of Python scripts in the Simple Rogue-like Game project. The original error was:

```
At line:1 char:2
+ a& C:/Users/Jozz/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python313/python.exe c ...
+  ~
The ampersand (&) character is not allowed. The & operator is reserved for future use; wrap an ampersand in double quotation marks ("&") to pass it as part of a string.
```

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Proper PowerShell Scripts

**New Files Added:**
- `run_game_simple.ps1` - Simple, reliable game launcher
- `run_tests_simple.ps1` - Comprehensive test runner
- `dev_utils.ps1` - Development utilities (advanced)
- `run_game.ps1` - Full-featured game launcher (with Unicode issues fixed)
- `run_tests.ps1` - Full-featured test runner (with Unicode issues fixed)

### 2. Fixed PowerShell Syntax Issues

**Before (Problematic):**
```powershell
# This causes ampersand errors
a& python main.py
```

**After (Correct):**
```powershell
# Use provided scripts
.\run_game_simple.ps1

# Or proper PowerShell syntax
& python main.py
```

### 3. Updated Documentation

**Files Updated:**
- `README.md` - Updated with correct PowerShell commands
