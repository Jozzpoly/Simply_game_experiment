- Level 1: 60x45 tiles â†’ Level 20: 120x90 tiles
- Room count scales from 37 to 75+ rooms
- Enemy density multiplier increases from 1.1x to 3.0x

**Dynamic Enemy Density Scaling**
- Enemy count scales with level: Base 10 â†’ Up to 70 enemies
- Higher levels spawn more enemies per room
- Density multiplier: 10% more enemies per level

**Enemy Clustering Mechanics**
- Enemies spawn in tactical groups rather than randomly scattered
- Group sizes scale with level: 2-4 enemies â†’ 6-10 enemies
- Formation patterns: cluster, line, circle, wedge, defensive, ambush

**Room Variety Enhancement**
- Multiple room types: normal, treasure, challenge, arena, boss
- Room sizes scale with level progression
- Special room probability increases with level (25-40%)
- Arena rooms for large-scale battles

### 2. Advanced Enemy AI Differentiation

**Five Distinct Enemy Types**
- **Normal**: Balanced baseline with tactical awareness
- **Fast**: Hit-and-run tactics, flanking behavior, high speed
- **Tank**: Defensive positioning, high health, area control
- **Sniper**: Long-range combat, predictive shooting, high damage
- **Berserker**: Aggressive assault, never retreats, rapid fire

**Group Coordination System**
- Enemies work together tactically within 200-pixel coordination range
- Role-based behavior: leader, scout, support, flanker, follower, assault
- Formation maintenance and tactical positioning
- Flanking maneuvers and coordinated attacks

**Advanced AI Behaviors**
- Retreat behavior when health drops below threshold
- Predictive movement and shooting
- Type-specific combat ranges and tactics
- Dynamic aggression levels and tactical decision making

**Enemy Formation Patterns**
- **Line Formation**: Enemies in coordinated lines
- **Circle Formation**: Surrounding tactics
- **Wedge Formation**: V-shaped assault patterns
- **Defensive Formation**: Protective positioning around leaders
- **Ambush Formation**: Scattered tactical positioning

### 3. Visual Enemy Differentiation

**Distinct Visual Appearances**
- **Normal**: Red coloring (255, 100, 100)
- **Fast**: Green coloring (100, 255, 100) with triangle indicator
- **Tank**: Blue coloring (100, 100, 255) with square indicator
- **Sniper**: Yellow coloring (255, 255, 100) with cross indicator
- **Berserker**: Magenta coloring (255, 100, 255) with X indicator

**Visual State Indicators**
- **Normal State**: Base enemy coloring
- **Aggressive State**: Brighter colors with pulsing red aura
- **Retreating State**: Muted colors with yellow warning triangle
- **Coordinating State**: Blue tint with coordination indicator

**Enhanced Visual Effects**
- Smooth color transitions between states (5-frame interpolation)
- Health bars with color coding (green â†’ yellow â†’ red)
- Type-specific indicators (shapes in corner)
- State-based visual effects (auras, warnings, indicators)

### 4. Enhanced Combat Mechanics

**Type-Specific Attack Patterns**
- **Sniper**: Predictive shooting with movement anticipation
- **Berserker**: Rapid-fire assault with high aggression
- **Fast**: Hit-and-run with flanking maneuvers
- **Tank**: Defensive positioning with area control
- **Normal**: Balanced tactical engagement

**Advanced Tactical Behaviors**
- Preferred combat ranges for each enemy type
- Dynamic positioning based on player movement
- Coordinated group attacks and flanking
- Retreat and reposition tactics
