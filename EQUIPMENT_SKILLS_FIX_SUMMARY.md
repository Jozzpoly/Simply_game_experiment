# Equipment and Skill System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Equipment Health Bonuses Not Applied ✅
**Problem**: Equipment with `health_bonus` stats were not affecting the player's maximum health.

**Solution**: 
- Added `get_effective_max_health()` method to Player class
- This method calculates total max health including equipment bonuses
- Updated `heal()` method to use effective max health instead of base max health
- Updated UI to display effective max health

**Code Changes**:
```python
def get_effective_max_health(self) -> int:
    """Get effective max health including equipment bonuses"""
    base_max_health = self.max_health
    equipment_bonus = self.equipment_manager.get_total_stat_bonus("health_bonus")
    total_max_health = int(base_max_health + equipment_bonus)
    return total_max_health
```

### 2. Equipment Regeneration Not Working ✅
**Problem**: Equipment with `regeneration` stats were not providing health regeneration.

**Solution**:
- Modified `apply_skill_effects()` method to include equipment regeneration
- Combined skill-based and equipment-based regeneration
- Added default regeneration interval for equipment (60 frames = 1 second)
- Updated to use effective max health for regeneration cap

**Code Changes**:
```python
def apply_skill_effects(self) -> None:
    # Health regeneration from skills
    skill_regen_amount = self.skill_tree.get_total_bonus("regen_amount")
    
    # Health regeneration from equipment
    equipment_regen_amount = self.equipment_manager.get_total_stat_bonus("regeneration")
    
    # Total regeneration amount
    total_regen_amount = skill_regen_amount + equipment_regen_amount
    
    if total_regen_amount > 0:
        # Use skill regen interval if available, otherwise default to 60 frames
        regen_interval = self.skill_tree.get_skill_bonus("health_regeneration", "regen_interval")
        if regen_interval <= 0:
            regen_interval = 60  # Default interval for equipment regeneration
            
        self.regen_timer += 1
        if self.regen_timer >= regen_interval:
            self.regen_timer = 0
            effective_max_health = self.get_effective_max_health()
            if self.health < effective_max_health:
                self.heal(int(total_regen_amount))
```

### 3. Skill Tree Clicking Not Working ✅
**Problem**: Clicking on skills in the skill tree was not upgrading them properly.

**Solution**:
- Improved skill tree click detection in UI
- Added proper left mouse button filtering
- Enhanced skill upgrade validation
- Removed debug prints for cleaner experience

**Code Changes**:
```python
def _handle_skills_click(self, event, player):
    """Handle clicks in the skills tab"""
    if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN and event.button == 1:  # Left mouse button only
        mouse_pos = pygame.mouse.get_pos()

        # Check if any skill was clicked
        for skill_name, skill_rect in self.skill_buttons.items():
            if skill_rect.collidepoint(mouse_pos):
                # Check if skill can be upgraded
                if player.skill_tree.can_upgrade_skill(skill_name):
                    if player.skill_tree.upgrade_skill(skill_name):
                        return f"skill_{skill_name}"

    return None
```

### 4. UI Not Showing Effective Stats ✅
**Problem**: The upgrade screen was showing base stats instead of effective stats including equipment bonuses.

**Solution**:
- Updated stats display to show effective stats
- Added equipment bonus calculations to UI
- Shows combined values from base stats + equipment bonuses

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Draw each stat (showing effective stats with equipment bonuses)
effective_max_health = self.player.get_effective_max_health()
effective_damage = self.player.get_effective_damage()
effective_speed = self.player.get_effective_speed()
effective_fire_rate = self.player.get_effective_fire_rate()

stats = [
    f"Level: {self.player.level}",
    f"Health: {self.player.health}/{effective_max_health}",
    f"Damage: {effective_damage:.1f}",
    f"Speed: {effective_speed:.1f}",
    f"Fire Rate: {effective_fire_rate}ms"
]
```

## Test Results

All systems have been thoroughly tested with comprehensive integration tests:

### Equipment Health Bonus Test ✅
- Equipment with health bonuses properly increase max health
- Player can heal up to the new effective max health
- UI displays the correct effective max health

### Equipment Regeneration Test ✅
- Equipment with regeneration stats provide health regeneration
- Regeneration works in the game loop
- Regeneration respects effective max health limits

### Skill Tree Upgrade Test ✅
- Skills can be upgraded by clicking on them
- Skill points are properly consumed
- Skill bonuses are correctly applied

### Integrated Systems Test ✅
- Equipment and skill bonuses stack correctly
- Critical chance, damage, and other stats combine properly
- UI shows accurate combined values

## How to Test

1. **Equipment Health Bonus**:
   - Equip armor with `health_bonus`
   - Check that max health increases in the stats screen
   - Verify you can heal above your base max health

2. **Equipment Regeneration**:
   - Equip armor with `regeneration` stat
   - Take damage to reduce health below max
   - Wait and observe health regenerating over time

3. **Skill Tree**:
   - Open upgrade screen (U key)
   - Go to Skills tab
   - Click on available skills to upgrade them
   - Verify skill points are consumed and bonuses applied

4. **Combined Systems**:
   - Equip items with various stat bonuses
   - Upgrade relevant skills
   - Check that all bonuses stack correctly in the stats display

## Files Modified

- `entities/player.py` - Added effective stat calculations and equipment integration
- `ui/ui_elements.py` - Improved skill tree clicking and stats display
- `test_equipment_skills_fix.py` - Basic functionality tests
- `test_game_integration.py` - Comprehensive integration tests

## Summary

The equipment and skill systems are now fully functional:
- ✅ Equipment bonuses properly affect player stats
- ✅ Equipment regeneration works correctly
- ✅ Skill tree upgrades work via clicking
- ✅ UI displays accurate effective stats
- ✅ All systems integrate seamlessly

Players can now enjoy the full character progression experience with working equipment bonuses and skill upgrades!
